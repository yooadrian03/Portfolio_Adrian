          <p>This project was the first assigned project in CSP, which was creating a game or story by using only Scratch. For this project, my partner and I decided to create a Maze Game that will be more complicated to escape as the player passes the levels. As more games produced, many games need a strategy to win a game and have to think hard. My specific role was programming the codes. First, we decided to create a map for each level and a yellow ball for a sprite. Then, I made a code that can move a sprite by using arrows and a code that will change the backdrop by following the requirements for this project. But I also faced a challenge, which was a coding error. I noticed that sometimes the backdrop didn't change at all when the level is completed or switch to the random backdrop. So I reorganized the codes and slowly observed if the code was in the correct form. As I checked each code, I noticed that I didn't put some codes correct orders for switching backdrop. As soon as I ran the code again after fixing the code, the backdrop switched in the correct order. I learned the basic structures of how to program games or stories, and how to work as a team. One thing that made us successful at this project was communication and responsibility for each own work. We had a conversation every week about how we can improve the game better. I had a responsibility to create and edit our game as a programmer. My partner had a responsibility to organize what we have done each day and explain what our game is about in this project's notebook.</p>

          <p>This project was the 7th assigned project in CSP, which was creating an image that satisfies the client's requirements. For this project, my partner and I decided to manipulate a family picture that has the silhouette of family members in yellow with their heart in the middle of chest because our client wanted to have a family picture that is meaningful to them. My specific role was programming the codes to manipulate an image. First, we decided to pick up different pictures that represent the family and a picture of heart. Then, I made a code that changes the color of the specific region in an image to yellow, so the family would look like a silhouette. But I also faced a challenge. I noticed that the code didn't fully change the color of the specific region to yellow because my code changes the pixels when the RGB value passes a certain amount. But our first family picture has too many different color in each pixel. So we picked another picture that can change the color of area more easily. After I switched the picture and ran the code again, I successfully changed the silhouette of family members in yellow instead of black. I learned how to manipulate an image by using different functions and libraries in Python. One thing that made us successful at this project was communication and responsibility for each own work. We had a conversation almost everyday about how we can satisfy our client's request. I had a responsibility to  edit final image as a developer. My partner had a responsibility to organize what we have done each day and create a presentation for our client.</p>

          <figcaption class="figure-caption">Hello!, my name is Adrian Yoo who is currently rolling in CSP class in Dublin High School. I'm a Sophomore who wants to become an engineer to participate in NASA as a robotic engineer. I'm 16 years old and I've been lived in Korea for 10 years since I was 3 years old, and came back to U.S. I learned how to play guitar, chess, Go game, golf, and soccer. I also participated in Video Production when I was in middle school.

          <p>A Chinese philosopher, Confucius, said, "Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life." My current career goal is becoming a robotic or mechanical engineer and getting into NASA because when I was young, I really liked to build robots in the Robotic Club by using LEGO. My plan is studying basic knowledge about engineering in Dublin High School and learn some key knowledges during the college years.</p> 
          <p>I possess creativity, supportiveness, and experience for this career. I possess creativity because being intelligent might be important for engineering, but creativity is a skill that helps to find a solution and to learn new things. When I worked on a project with my partner, I learned that there are ample opportunities to throw away conventional ways of thinking and be imaginative because engineers have to keep adapting to changing situations as problem solvers. Being supportive is also important especially when I have to work as a team. I learned that if I can't be supportive to my teammate I will never be successful in group work because teamwork needs collaboration including the projects that I did in CSP. I knew that I can't solve problems just by myself. Finally, having more experience is really important because everyone learns from his or her mistakes and uses the knowledge to become better, so he or she won't make the same mistakes. I learned that if I don't make any mistakes, I wonâ€™t learn anything, and if I don't learn anything, I won't change.</p>
          <p>Some of my major accomplishments in high school were getting straight A's for all semester throughout Freshman year, chosen as a team ambassador in the golf team, and over 20 hours of volunteering currently. I have participated in the school golf team, soccer team as an outside club, Speech & Debate, Drawing, Video Production, etc. I learned that I'm very hardworking when I took a difficult class, supportive when I'm in the sports team, and very humorous especially when I talk and work with different types of people. I don't have any work experience yet except for some volunteer works, which taught me a lesson about why people pay money when he or she works at a company or workplace.</p>
          <p>Overall, my career goal is becoming an engineer that relates to a mechanic, which requires me to have creative, supportive, and some experiences from my high school years and accomplishments, and always try my best on everything I participate in. Thank you for your time and I hope you enjoy my website!</p>
